# Inversion Counter
Implements the inversion counting algorithm, used to quantify how far an array is from being sorted.

## Usage
You must send in your input to the program via stdin!

Below is an example of running the program, using input file test1000.txt

`python count_inversions.py < test1000.txt`

## Note
The input file used must be formatted like so:
[2 5 6 3 2 6 8
3 5 6 7 3 2 6 7]

Note the brackets on either end of the list of numbers, however the list must be delimited with spaces, not commas.
